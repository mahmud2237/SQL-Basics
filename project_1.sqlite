-- Create a table named friends with three columns: id that stores INTEGER, name that stores TEXT, birthday that stores DATE

-- Beneath your current code, add Ororo Munroe to friends. Her birthday is May 30th, 1940.
INSERT INTO friends (id, name, birthday) VALUES (1, 'Ororo Munroe', '30-05-1940');
-- Add two more of your friends to the table. Insert an id, name, and birthday for each of them.
